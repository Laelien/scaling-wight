Saturday 02:00 Waiting for the theme. One hour to go. Gaeel is talking, and talking, and talking, and I'm pretending to listen. It's gonna be tough. I'm already short on beer. And tobacco. Oh well, let's try to work sober for once.

Saturday 03:00 OKAY, I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS. Let's try and make this feeling last. For more than ten seconds, that is.

Saturday 03:15 Got this idea. Let's do it. Hope it turns out well. Brainstorming in here for everyone.

Saturday 06:15 I've got a working character, enemy and death. I'm pretty glad with what I've done so far actually. Now to add some juicyness : graphics, several kind of enemies, and sounds. Once it's done, I'll be able to create levels.

Saturday 10:38 Okay, three hours on this crappy background is waaaay more than enough. Let's not waste any more time on this.

Saturday 11:12 OKAY, I CAN TOTALLY DO THIS. Maybe.

Saturday 12:16 An hour on a stupid bug. Wrote < instead of >. I'm getting slightly mad.

Saturday 12:37 Every collision works, you can win, you can lose. Well. Let's make more enemies now ! The rest of the juiciness can wait. When it's done and working, I'll just need to make levels and sounds, and I'll be done !
